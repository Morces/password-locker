# Password-Locker
## Description
On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.

With the knowledge and skills we have now, we will create an amazing application that will help us manage our passwords and even generate new passwords for us.

## Behaviour Driven Development
- Users can create accounts using a username and a pasword that can either be autogenerated by the system or customized by the user.
- Display the usernames of the accounts created.
- Find the user accounts
- Delete the user account
